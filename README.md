# CSharpAdv_Assignment2 - OOP section

## Encapsulation: In this project, the implementation details of the objects are hidden within their respective classes. For example, the Student class encapsulates the implementation details of a student, including their name, email, phone, and address. The implementation details of the Person class are also encapsulated.

## Inheritance: The Student class inherits from the Person class, allowing it to reuse the implementation details of the Person class.

## Polymorphism: This project demonstrates polymorphism through the use of interfaces. The ICourse and IPresenter interfaces define a set of methods that classes can implement. This allows for different classes to implement the same interface and have different implementations of the interface methods.

## Abstraction: The Person class is an abstract class that defines a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by any class that inherits from it. This allows for the essential characteristics of a person to be defined in the abstract class, while the specific implementation details are defined in the inheriting classes.
